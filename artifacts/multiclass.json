    "description": "One-vs-one multiclass strategy This strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class pair. At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected. Since it requires to fit `n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2` classifiers, this method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its O(n_classes^2) complexity. However, this method may be advantageous for algorithms such as kernel algorithms which don't scale well with `n_samples`. This is because each individual learning problem only involves a small subset of the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete dataset is used `n_classes` times.

    "description": "One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multiclass/multilabel strategy Also known as one-vs-all, this strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class. For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes. In addition to its computational efficiency (only `n_classes` classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy for multiclass classification and is a fair default choice.  This strategy can also be used for multilabel learning, where a classifier is used to predict multiple labels for instance, by fitting on a 2-d matrix in which cell [i, j] is 1 if sample i has label j and 0 otherwise.  In the multilabel learning literature, OvR is also known as the binary relevance method.  Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <ovr_classification>`.",

At fitting time, one binary classifier per bit in the code book is fitted.  At prediction time, the classifiers are used to project new points in the class space and the class closest to the points is chosen. The main advantage of these strategies is that the number of classifiers used can be controlled by the user, either for compressing the model (0 < code_size < 1) or for making the model more robust to errors (code_size > 1).
